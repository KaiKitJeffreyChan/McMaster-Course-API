# McMaster Course Scrape

Returns CSV of McMaster course information.
Scraped data using Selenium library.

If you want to use this script, make sure you install selenium's chromedriver and have it in the correct location.

FYI, This only scrapes information from the McMaster Calender (I noticed that its not always updated, etc there are courses listed on McMaster's CAS website that are not yet on the calender)
